Recently, I Discovered To Install Modules Without The CMD And I Found A Way. With "Os" Module I Installed With Pip. I Was Too Curious And I Searched More About That Module And Function Which I Found And Discovered That The Function Was Related To CMD And A Idea Came To My Mind, Making A Linux Like Terminal! So I Began This Project. I Named This As "Terminal". This Project Is Currently Under Development. I Recommend You To Use The Terminal Stable Versions Which Will Be Released Later.

Happy Coding!
