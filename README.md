# PyTerm

Recently, I discovered a way to install modules without the CMD.  One way to do this is with the "OS" module. Next, i searched for more information about this function on the web, and I found that it is related to the CMD. Then I had the idea, to make a Linux like Terminal! So I Began this project. 

As always, Happy Coding!
